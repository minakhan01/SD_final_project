### Topic of Study: Event-driven programming using callbacks and publish-subscribe pattern

In computer programming, event-driven programming or event-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by eventsâ€”i.e., sensor outputs or user actions (mouse clicks, key presses) or messages from other programs or threads [1](http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Event-driven_programming.html). Event handlers are a common manifestation of event-driven programming, and these are widely used in web applications.

Publish/Subscribe are a type of event programming.
